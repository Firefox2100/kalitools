```

### dnswalk Options

```
-r   Recursively descend sub-domains of the specified domain.
-a   Turn on warning of duplicate A records.
-d   Print debugging and 'status' information to stderr. (Use only if redirecting stdout).
-m   Perform checks only if the zone has been modified since the previous run.
-F   Perform "fascist" checking. When checking an A record, compare the PTR name for each IP address with the forward name and report mismatches.
-i   Suppress check for invalid characters in a domain name.
-l   Perform "lame delegation" checking.  For every NS record, check to see that the listed host is indeed returning authoritative answers for this domain.
```
