You can alsospecify the target as IPnetwork/bits (e.g. 192.168.1.0/24) to specify all hostsin the given network (network and broadcast addresses included), orIPstart-IPend (e.g. 192.168.1.3-192.168.1.27) to specify all hosts in theinclusive range, or IPnetwork:NetMask (e.g. 192.168.1.0:255.255.255.0) tospecify all hosts in the given network and mask.These different options for specifying target hosts may be used both on thecommand line, and also in the file specified with the --file option.Options:Note: where an option takes a value, that value is specified as a letter inangle brackets. The letter indicates the type of data that is expected:<s> A character string, e.g. --file=hostlist.txt.</s><i> An integer, which can be specified as a decimal number or as a hexadecimalnumber if preceded with 0x, e.g. --arppro=2048 or --arpro=0x0800.</i>A floating point decimal number, e.g. --backoff=1.5.An Ethernet MAC address, which can be specified either in the format01:23:45:67:89:ab, or as 01-23-45-67-89-ab. The alphabetic hex charactersmay be either upper or lower case. E.g. --arpsha=01:23:45:67:89:ab.<a> An IPv4 address, e.g. --arpspa=10.0.0.1</a>Binary data specified as a hexadecimal string, which should notinclude a leading 0x. The alphabetic hex characters may be eitherupper or lower case. E.g. --padding=aaaaaaaaaaaaSomething else. See the description of the option for details.--help or -h Display this usage message and exit.--file=<s> or -f <s> Read hostnames or addresses from the specified fileinstead of from the command line. One name or IPaddress per line. Use "-" for standard input.</s></s>--localnet or -l Generate addresses from network interface configuration.Use the network interface IP address and network maskto generate the list of target host addresses.The list will include the network and broadcastaddresses, so an interface address of 10.0.0.1 withnetmask 255.255.255.0 would generate 256 targethosts from 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.0.255 inclusive.If you use this option, you cannot specify the --fileoption or specify any target hosts on the command line.The interface specifications are taken from theinterface that arp-scan will use, which can bechanged with the --interface option.--retry=<i> or -r <i> Set total number of attempts per host to <i>,default=2.</i></i></i>--timeout=<i> or -t <i> Set initial per host timeout to <i> ms, default=500.This timeout is for the first packet sent to each host.subsequent timeouts are multiplied by the backofffactor which is set with --backoff.</i></i></i>--interval= or -i Set minimum packet interval to .This controls the outgoing bandwidth usage by limitingthe rate at which packets can be sent. The packetinterval will be no smaller than this number.If you want to use up to a given bandwidth, then it iseasier to use the --bandwidth option instead.The interval specified is in milliseconds by default,or in microseconds if "u" is appended to the value.--bandwidth= or -B Set desired outbound bandwidth to , default=256000.The value is in bits per second by default. If youappend "K" to the value, then the units are kilobitsper sec; and if you append "M" to the value, theunits are megabits per second.The "K" and "M" suffixes represent the decimal, notbinary, multiples. So 64K is 64000, not 65536.You cannot specify both --interval and --bandwidthbecause they are just different ways to change thesame underlying parameter.--backoff= or -b Set timeout backoff factor to , default=1.50.The per-host timeout is multiplied by this factorafter each timeout. So, if the number of retriesis 3, the initial per-host timeout is 500ms and thebackoff factor is 1.5, then the first timeout will be500ms, the second 750ms and the third 1125ms.--verbose or -v Display verbose progress messages.Use more than once for greater effect:1 - Display the network address and mask used when the--localnet option is specified, display anynonzero packet padding, display packets receivedfrom unknown hosts, and show when each pass throughthe list completes.2 - Show each packet sent and received, when entriesare removed from the list, the pcap filter string,and counts of MAC/Vendor mapping entries.3 - Display the host list before scanning starts.--version or -V Display program version and exit.--random or -R Randomise the host list.This option randomises the order of the hosts in thehost list, so the ARP packets are sent to the hosts ina random order. It uses the Knuth shuffle algorithm.--numeric or -N IP addresses only, no hostnames.With this option, all hosts must be specified asIP addresses. Hostnames are not permitted. No DNSlookups will be performed.--snap=<i> or -n <i> Set the pcap snap length to <i>. Default=64.This specifies the frame capture length. Thislength includes the data-link header.The default is normally sufficient.</i></i></i>--interface=<s> or -I <s> Use network interface <s>.If this option is not specified, arp-scan will searchthe system interface list for the lowest numbered,configured up interface (excluding loopback).The interface specified must support ARP.</s></s></s>--quiet or -q Only display minimal output.If this option is specified, then only the minimuminformation is displayed. With this option, theOUI files are not used.--ignoredups or -g Don't display duplicate packets.By default, duplicate packets are displayed and areflagged with "(DUP: n)".--ouifile=<s> or -O <s> Use IEEE Ethernet OUI to vendor mapping file <s>.If this option is not specified, the default filenameis ieee-oui.txt in the current directory. If that isnot found, then the file/usr/share/arp-scan/ieee-oui.txt is used.</s></s></s>--iabfile=<s> or -O <s> Use IEEE Ethernet IAB to vendor mapping file <s>.If this option is not specified, the default filenameis ieee-iab.txt in the current directory. If that isnot found, then the file/usr/share/arp-scan/ieee-iab.txt is used.</s></s></s>--macfile=<s> or -O <s> Use custom Ethernet MAC to vendor mapping file <s>.If this option is not specified, the default filenameis mac-vendor.txt in the current directory. If that isnot found, then the file/usr/share/arp-scan/mac-vendor.txt is used.</s></s></s>--srcaddr= or -S Set the source Ethernet MAC address to .This sets the 48-bit hardware address in the Ethernetframe header for outgoing ARP packets. It does notchange the hardware address in the ARP packet, see--arpsha for details on how to change that address.The default is the Ethernet address of the outgoinginterface.--destaddr= or -T Send the packets to Ethernet MAC addressThis sets the 48-bit destination address in theEthernet frame header.The default is the broadcast address ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff.Most operating systems will also respond if the ARPrequest is sent to their MAC address, or to amulticast address that they are listening on.--arpsha= or -u Use as the ARP source Ethernet addressThis sets the 48-bit ar$sha field in the ARP packetIt does not change the hardware address in the frameheader, see --srcaddr for details on how to changethat address. The default is the Ethernet address ofthe outgoing interface.--arptha= or -w Use as the ARP target Ethernet addressThis sets the 48-bit ar$tha field in the ARP packetThe default is zero, because this field is not usedfor ARP request packets.--prototype=<i> or -y <i> Set the Ethernet protocol type to <i>, default=0x0806.This sets the 16-bit protocol type field in theEthernet frame header.Setting this to a non-default value will result in thepacket being ignored by the target, or sent to thewrong protocol stack.</i></i></i>--arphrd=<i> or -H <i> Use <i> for the ARP hardware type, default=1.This sets the 16-bit ar$hrd field in the ARP packet.The normal value is 1 (ARPHRD_ETHER). Most, but notall, operating systems will also respond to 6(ARPHRD_IEEE802). A few systems respond to any value.</i></i></i>--arppro=<i> or -p <i> Use <i> for the ARP protocol type, default=0x0800.This sets the 16-bit ar$pro field in the ARP packet.Most operating systems only respond to 0x0800 (IPv4)but some will respond to other values as well.</i></i></i>--arphln=<i> or -a <i> Set the hardware address length to <i>, default=6.This sets the 8-bit ar$hln field in the ARP packet.It sets the claimed length of the hardware addressin the ARP packet. Setting it to any value other thanthe default will make the packet non RFC compliant.Some operating systems may still respond to it though.Note that the actual lengths of the ar$sha and ar$thafields in the ARP packet are not changed by thisoption; it only changes the ar$hln field.</i></i></i>--arppln=<i> or -P <i> Set the protocol address length to <i>, default=4.This sets the 8-bit ar$pln field in the ARP packet.It sets the claimed length of the protocol addressin the ARP packet. Setting it to any value other thanthe default will make the packet non RFC compliant.Some operating systems may still respond to it though.Note that the actual lengths of the ar$spa and ar$tpafields in the ARP packet are not changed by thisoption; it only changes the ar$pln field.</i></i></i>--arpop=<i> or -o <i> Use <i> for the ARP operation, default=1.This sets the 16-bit ar$op field in the ARP packet.Most operating systems will only respond to the value 1(ARPOP_REQUEST). However, some systems will respondto other values as well.</i></i></i>--arpspa=<a> or -s </a><a> Use </a><a> as the source IP address.The address should be specified in dotted quad format;or the literal string "dest", which sets the sourceaddress to be the same as the target host address.This sets the 32-bit ar$spa field in the ARP packet.Some operating systems check this, and will onlyrespond if the source address is within the networkof the receiving interface. Others don't care, andwill respond to any source address.By default, the outgoing interface address is used.</a>WARNING: Setting ar$spa to the destination IP addresscan disrupt some operating systems, as they assumethere is an IP address clash if they receive an ARPrequest for their own address.--padding= or -A Specify padding after packet data.Set the padding data to hex value . This data isappended to the end of the ARP packet, after the data.Most, if not all, operating systems will ignore anypadding. The default is no padding, although theEthernet driver on the sending system may pad thepacket to the minimum Ethernet frame length.--llc or -L Use RFC 1042 LLC framing with SNAP.This option causes the outgoing ARP packets to useIEEE 802.2 framing with a SNAP header as describedin RFC 1042. The default is to use Ethernet-IIframing.arp-scan will decode and display received ARP packetsin either Ethernet-II or IEEE 802.2 formatsirrespective of this option.--vlan=<i> or -Q <i> Use 802.1Q tagging with VLAN id <i>.This option causes the outgoing ARP packets to use802.1Q VLAN tagging with a VLAN ID of <i>, which shouldbe in the range 0 to 4095 inclusive.arp-scan will always decode and display received ARPpackets in 802.1Q format irrespective of this option.</i></i></i></i>--pcapsavefile=<s> or -W <s> Write received packets to pcap savefile <s>.This option causes received ARP responses to be writtento the specified pcap savefile as well as being decodedand displayed. This savefile can be analysed withprograms that understand the pcap file format, such as"tcpdump" and "wireshark".</s></s></s>--rtt or -D Display the packet round-trip time.Report bugs or send suggestions to arp-scan@nta-monitor.comSee the arp-scan homepage at http://www.nta-monitor.com/tools/arp-scan/
