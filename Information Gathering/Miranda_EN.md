## Miranda Package Description

Miranda is a Python-based Universal Plug-N-Play client application designed to discover, query and interact with UPNP devices, particularly Internet Gateway Devices (aka, routers). It can be used to audit UPNP-enabled devices on a network for possible vulnerabilities. Some of its features include:

- Interactive shell with tab completion and command history
- Passive and active discovery of UPNP devices
- Customizable MSEARCH queries (query for specific devices/services)
- Full control over application settings such as IP addresses, ports and headers
- Simple enumeration of UPNP devices, services, actions and variables
- Correlation of input/output state variables with service actions
- Ability to send actions to UPNP services/devices
- Ability to save data to file for later analysis and collaboration
- Command logging

Miranda was built on and for a Linux system and has been tested on a Linux 2.6 kernel with Python 2.5. However, since it is written in Python, most functionality should be available for any Python-supported platform. Miranda has been tested against IGDs from various vendors, including Linksys, D-Link, Belkin and ActionTec. All Python modules came installed by default on a Linux Mint 5 (Ubuntu 8.04) test system.
